### Our first camping experience

Once upon a time a couple who've never had experience doing outdoor activities (like camping), decide it was time to have a new adventure.

They have a good friend of them who did it a few times and he was always talking how amazing it's the feeling to hike and finish the day with camping in an amazing spot with alluring views.
So after a lot of research (almost 3 months), watching vedeos on youtube, reading articles about it, getting tips from friends, they started to buy gears and planned their first camping.

We bought everything we need it to have our first experience. Then we had to decide where we gonna do it and plan how long we would gonna stay, which kinda food to bring etc.

WITH EVERYTHING SET, IT WAS TIME TO GO :)

We found an amazing place not to far from North Sydney, so we decided to spend only one night there because we didn't know if we would like it.
And guys we didn't like it, WE LOVE IT, was a grateful, delightful experience we've had so far. 

And now, after doing through this experience, I think WE WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP IT ANYMORE :)
