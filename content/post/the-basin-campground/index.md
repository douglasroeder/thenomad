### Our first camping experience

Once upon a time a couple who have never had experience doing outdoor activities (like camping), decided it was time to have a new adventure.

We have a good friend who did it a few times and he was always talking how amazing it's the feeling to hike and finish the day with camping in an amazing spot with alluring views.

So after a lot of research (almost 3 months), watching videos on youtube, reading articles about it, getting tips from friends, we started to buy gears and planned our first camping.

We bought everything we needed to have on our first experience. Then we had to decide where we gonna do it and plan how long we would gonna stay, which kinda food to bring, etc.

WITH EVERYTHING SET, IT WAS TIME TO GO :)

We found an amazing place not to far from North Sydney, so we decided to spend only one night there because we didn't know if we would going to like it.
And guys we didn't like it, WE LOVED IT, was a grateful and delightful experience we've had so far. 

And now, after going through this experience, I think WE WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP IT ANYMORE :)
