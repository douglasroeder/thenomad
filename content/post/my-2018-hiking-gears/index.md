As a real newbie in hiking, I wanted to write down a list of all my gear at the current point in time and probably reason about the things that have worked and not worked so well through my hiking adventures.

Alright, the plan is for me to give you a list of all my gears, so here it goes:

### Backpack
##### Entrada 65L Backpack v2

That's probably not the ideal backpack for hiking, but since I bought it for some holidays in Europe, I've decided to use it anyway. Although it is working fine, I reckon a proper hiking backpack would be ideal.

### Tent
##### Chronos Dome 2 - Mont-bel

Pros:

* 2 people can sleep comfortably in it
* 3 season
* not that heavy, around 2.1kg
* really easy to pitch

Cons:

* vestibule area could be a bit bigger
