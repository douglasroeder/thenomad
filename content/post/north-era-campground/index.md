###Royal National Park - Bundeena to Otford Lookout

Last weekend we did our first camping with hiking.
We have been planing this for week. Before we get our stuff ready and put the foot on the road.

We already did a lot of hiking and a few campings, but both together requires you carry backpack, it's completely different. My backpack had 8 kilos and my husband's backpack had 14 kilos.

WITH EVERYTHING SET, IT WAS TIME TO GO.

We woke up early to go, it was an exquisite Friday morning around 9 o'clock when we started to walk.
I can tell you people was tough, but each view we cross by was stunning, it was the same to win a prize.

The NATURE IS DEVINE, WE CAN ABSORB SO MUCH FROM IT.

We started walking from Bundeena to North Era and there we pitched our tent, we were exausted after having walked 24 km, we had dinner and an amazing night.

Then the next day we woke up at 7 o'clock, we fixed breakfast, we packed everything and started to walk again, now from North Era to Otford lookout. The second day and last one we walked only 13 km, but I was so tired that I felt it was harder than the first day, maybe because I am not fit enough, yet.

So at the end of the day I got a few blisters in my feet and at the same time feelin of happiness, because WE WAS ABLE TO DO IT.

Being happy doing something you enjoy means being happy in life.
